<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<p>There are several types of concurrency bugs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Race</li>
  <li>Deadlock</li>
  <li>Order Violation</li>
  <li>Suspension</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
  <li>Atomicity Violation</li>
  <li>Livelock</li>
</ul>

<p>An <strong>atomicity violation</strong> is when there is “[s]erialized access to shared memory among separate threads is not enforced (e.g. non-atomic).” The fix is to add locks for all uses of a shared memory resource. We can tell if a variable is shared merely by looking at the code and seeing where it is used. We should be watchful of a variable’s scope.</p>

<p>An <strong>order violation</strong> is when the desired order of access is inverted. An example is assigning a value to a variable before initializing the variable. The solution is to use condition variables.</p>

<p><strong>Deadlock</strong> is when all threads are blocked. “If one [thread] tries to access a resource that a second [thread] holds, and vice-versa, they can never make progress.” Deadlock arises from incorrect synchronization among a set of threads “if every [thread] is waiting for an event that can be caused only by another [thread] in the set.” The solution is to lock the locks in the same order for each thread every time.</p>
