<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome, fellow student! This page is where you’ll find the notes I’ve typed for TCSS 422 - Computer Operating Systems in the Spring 2022 quarter. (Please refer to the footer for copyright information.) I hope you’ll find this page as helpful as I do. I’ll be updating this site regularly throughout the quarter, so check in regularly. Please do not substitute reading this page for coming to class.</p>

<p>Those outside University of Washington Tacoma will certainly find this resource helpful, as well. All are welcome to come and learn.</p>

<p>I built this page by using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a popular static-site generator. This means I’m typing up my notes in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which Jekyll compiles into HTML. If you want to talk about the technical details, I’d be more than happy to.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-operating-system">What Is an Operating System?</h2>

<p>The <strong>operating system</strong> (OS) handles the communication between input/output devices and CPU/memory. It is a resource manager that handles the hardware for one’s programs. An operating system is <em>software</em>. Many operating systems are written in <strong>C</strong>, so that’s the language we’ll be using in this class. It’s more predictable than a higher-level language like Java or Python. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html">The GNU C Reference Manual</a> is a great resource. Here’s what a simple program in C looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="n">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>
